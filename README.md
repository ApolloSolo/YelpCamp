This project was deployed through Heroku and can be found here: https://aqueous-refuge-67160.herokuapp.com/
Disclaimer: I did not code this myself. This was a code along project though a Udemy course with Colt Steele (awesome courses by the way). This was my first dive into Node and Express (amongst many other tech and concepts). The development of this app has helped me build and deploy my first node project ( https://rocky-anchorage-78391.herokuapp.com/ ), which is currently in use on an environmental remediation project.
